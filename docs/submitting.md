# Submissions

After the participants run their models on the given test set for each rung, they will store their results in a binary pickle file. The format of these pickle files, as well as the parameters being evaluated, can be found in the notebooks [here](https://github.com/ahuang314/Roman_Data_Challenge/tree/main/Notebooks).

The pickle files should be emailed to roman_data_challenge_submissions@googlegroups.com (TODO: currently this Google Group has not yet been created). In the email subject, please include which rung the submission corresponds to. In the email body, please include the names, emails, and affiliations of all team members associated with the submission.
