The goal of this rung is to serve as a tutorial for participants. You will familiarize yourself with the systematics of the challenge (e.g. where and how to submit, how to set up mejiro and obtain/generate datasets, where to find relevant documentation) and for us as the organizers to make sure that the data challenge runs smoothly.

The dataset for this rung, which consists of 10,737 lenses stored in an h5 file, can be downloaded [here](https://gowustl-my.sharepoint.com/personal/b_t_wedig_wustl_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fb%5Ft%5Fwedig%5Fwustl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2025%2D09%2D19%20Roman%20Data%20Challenge%20mini%20dataset%2Froman%5Fdata%5Fchallenge%5Fmini%5Fv%5F0%5F1%2Eh5&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fb%5Ft%5Fwedig%5Fwustl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2025%2D09%2D19%20Roman%20Data%20Challenge%20mini%20dataset&ga=1). A Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to access and manipulate the data can be found [here](https://gowustl-my.sharepoint.com/personal/b_t_wedig_wustl_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fb%5Ft%5Fwedig%5Fwustl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2025%2D09%2D19%20Roman%20Data%20Challenge%20mini%20dataset%2Fview%5Fdataset%2Eipynb&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fb%5Ft%5Fwedig%5Fwustl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2025%2D09%2D19%20Roman%20Data%20Challenge%20mini%20dataset&ga=1). In this rung, you will train a regression model to determine the Einstein radius of lenses.
