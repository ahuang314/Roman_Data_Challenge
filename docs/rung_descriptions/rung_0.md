The goal of this rung is to serve as a tutorial for participants. You will familiarize yourself with the systematics of the challenge (e.g. where and how to submit, how to set up mejiro and obtain/generate datasets, where to find relevant documentation) and for us as the organizers to make sure that the data challenge runs smoothly.
