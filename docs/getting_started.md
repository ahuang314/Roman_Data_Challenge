Everyone is welcome to participate. Entries can be as a team or individual.

## Downloading the Datasets

The dataset for rung 0, which consists of 10,737 lenses stored in an h5 file, can be downloaded [here](https://gowustl-my.sharepoint.com/personal/b_t_wedig_wustl_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fb%5Ft%5Fwedig%5Fwustl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2025%2D09%2D19%20Roman%20Data%20Challenge%20mini%20dataset%2Froman%5Fdata%5Fchallenge%5Fmini%5Fv%5F0%5F1%2Eh5&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fb%5Ft%5Fwedig%5Fwustl%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F2025%2D09%2D19%20Roman%20Data%20Challenge%20mini%20dataset&ga=1)

    **instructions on how to download rungs 1, 2, and 3 datasets**

!!! note
    The datasets will continue to be updated through the data challenge as the simulation software receives updates. The *Roman* team is continuing to release updated performance data and simulation software continues to improve, so these updates will be reflected in future versions of the dataset. These updated datasets will have the same structure, so will be "plug and play" and require no additional effort from participants aside from downloading them as they become available.

## Working with the Datasets

[See here for a Jupyter notebook that explains the structure of the rung 0 dataset and demonstrates how to work with it.](https://github.com/AstroMusers/mejiro/blob/main/projects/roman_data_challenge/view_dataset.ipynb)
