# Getting Started

## Eligibility

Everyone is welcome to participate. Entries can be as a team or individual. If you wish to stay updated with announcements regarding the data challenge, please email the coordinators so that you can be added to the mailing list.

## Downloading and Working with the Datasets

!!! note
    The datasets will continue to be updated through the data challenge as the simulation software receives updates. The *Roman* team is continuing to release updated performance data and simulation software continues to improve, so these updates will be reflected in future versions of the dataset. These updated datasets will have the same structure, so will be "plug and play" and require no additional effort from participants aside from downloading them as they become available.
