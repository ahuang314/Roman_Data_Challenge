# Getting Started

## Eligibility

Everyone is welcome to participate. Entries can be as a team or individual. If you wish to stay updated with announcements regarding the data challenge, please email the coordinators so that you can be added to the mailing list.

## Downloading and Working with the Datasets

!!! note
    The datasets will continue to be updated through the data challenge as the simulation software receives 
updates. The *Roman* team is continuing to release updated performance data and simulation software 
continues to improve, so these updates will be reflected in future versions of the dataset. These updated 
datasets will have the same structure, so will be "plug and play" and require no additional effort from 
participants aside from downloading them as they become available.

### Rung 0

The training dataset for rung 0, which consists of 10,737 lenses stored in an h5 file, [can be downloaded here from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17391542). It is bundled with a notebook that demonstrates how to work with the dataset.

The test set which participants will submit their results for has not yet been generated. When it is generated, it will be downloadable from the same link.
