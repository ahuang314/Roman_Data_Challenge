# Submissions

Please prepare your results in a CSV file. The CSV files should be emailed to [alan.huang.1@stonybrook.edu](mailto:alan.huang.1@stonybrook.edu) and [b.t.wedig@wustl.edu](mailto:b.t.wedig@wustl.edu). 

!!! warning
    We are setting up [roman_data_challenge_submissions@googlegroups.com](mailto:roman_data_challenge_submissions@googlegroups.com) as the point of contact for all submissions, questions, and feedback for this data challenge. However, this has not yet been configured. This website will be updated once it is.

In the email subject, please include which rung the submission corresponds to. In the email body, please include the names, emails, and affiliations of all team members associated with the submission. The submitted CSV file should be named "{team name}_rung{rung number}_submission.csv". For all of the rungs, each submission will be graded from 0 to 100.

## Rung 0

In this rung, you will train a regression model to determine the Einstein radius of lenses. The submitted CSV file should contain the parameters "ID", "theta_E", and "theta_E_sigma" in the header row, with each row afterwards corresponding to the results for each of the lenses. An example can be found in the notebook [here](https://github.com/ahuang314/Roman_Data_Challenge/blob/main/Notebooks/rung0_submissions.ipynb).

!!! warning
    The deadline for Rung 0 submissions is TBA. Stay tuned for updates.

## Rung 1

In this rung, you will train a binary classification model to determine whether or not a simulated lens contains dark matter substructure. The submitted CSV file should contain the parameters "ID", "has_substructure" in the header row. with each row afterwards corresponding to the results for each of the lenses. An example can be found in the notebook [here](https://github.com/ahuang314/Roman_Data_Challenge/blob/main/Notebooks/rung1_submissions.ipynb).
