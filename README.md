# Roman Strong Lens Data Challenge

This repository houses the website and supporting code for the [Roman Strong Lens Data Challenge](https://roman-data-challenge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Overview

The *Roman Space Telescope* is expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses, providing high angular resolution images of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses that can be used to probe the nature of dark matter at sub-galactic scales ([Daylan and Birrer 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12864), [Wedig et al. 2025](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adc24f)). The [*Roman* Data Challenge for Dark Matter Substructure with Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Gravitational Lenses](https://roman-data-challenge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides realistic simulated *Roman* images of strong lenses with various dark matter substructure populations and challenges the community to test out substructure detection and characterization pipelines.
